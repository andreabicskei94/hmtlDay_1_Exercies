         Wise men say<br>
        Only fools rush in<br>
        But I can't help<br>
        Falling in love with you.<br>
        Shall I stay<br>
        Would it be a sin<br>
        If I can't help<br>
        Falling in love with you<br>
        Like a river flows<br>
        Surely to the sea<br>
        Darling, so it goes<br>
        Some things are meant to be<br>
        So take my hand<br>
        Take my whole life, too<br>
        For I can't help<br>
        Falling in love with you<br>
        Some things are meant to be<br>
        Take my hand<br>
        Take my whole life, too<br>
        For I can't help<br>
        Falling in love with you<br>
        For I can't help<br>
        Falling in love with you<br>
